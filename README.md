# A-deep-database-of-medical-abbreviations-and-acronyms-for-natural-language-processing
This program in a personal overview is an upgrade for the research paper already made by LisaGrossman Liu and team in 2021. We have added the keyword extraction in order to Summarize content by identifying and extracting key topics..
