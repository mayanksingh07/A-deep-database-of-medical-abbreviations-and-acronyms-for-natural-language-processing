# Medical-Abbreviations-database
This program in a personal overview is an upgrade for the research paper already made by LisaGrossman Liu and team in 2021. We have added the keyword extraction in order to Summarize content by identifying and extracting key topics..
For the program the pre refined data is available at https://github.com/lisavirginia/clinical-abbreviations/tree/master . We were unable to get the data to this repository because of the large size.
